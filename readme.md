The color macros for ansi are from: https://github.com/tomsik68/ansi_colors repo.

This is a simple library for C/C++ to log data trough stdout, the cmakelist file is meant for ESP-IDF, though is basic.
It's meant to be used by defining a macro in the file you intend to log, or just use either the LOG_GENERIC or LOG_E macro
for simple printf debbuging.
